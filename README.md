# Visualization Tool Activity ðŸ“Š

## Data Resources
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Project Overview
This project consists of three parts, focusing on data visualization using various libraries and tools. We explore datasets from Kaggle to analyze and represent data effectively.

### Part 1: Course 8 Week 1 & 2 Activity
In this section, we selected a dataset and created visualizations using different libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. 

#### Approach:
- **Dataset Selection:** Describe the dataset you chose.
- **Libraries Used:** List the libraries you implemented and why you selected them.
- **Visualizations Created:** Briefly explain the types of visualizations created and the insights gathered from them.

#### Evaluation:
Discuss whether the chosen tools were appropriate for representing and analyzing your selected dataset.

### Part 2: Course 8 Week 3 Activity
Building upon the previous work, we focused on advanced visualizations to uncover deeper insights.

#### Selected Visualizations:
- Waffle Charts
- Word Clouds
- Seaborn & Regression Plots
- Geospatial Data Visualization (using Folium, maps with markers, and Choropleth maps)

### Part 3: Course 8 Week 4 Activity
In the final part, we implemented a simple dashboard to showcase our visualizations.

#### Dashboard Implementation:
- Describe the dashboard's layout and functionality.
- Highlight any interactivity or features you added.
